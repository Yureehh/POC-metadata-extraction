COA: Search for 'Certificato di Analisi' or similar terms, usually presented with detailed analysis data in a tabular format, including test results and specifications. 3. DDT: Identify 'Documento di Trasporto' or related phrases, focusing on transport details like sender, receiver, and shipment information.
